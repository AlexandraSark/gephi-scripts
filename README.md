gephi-scripts
=============

Python text processing scripts to prepare textual data for use with Gephi. 


gephi-wordpairs-5.py was created for use in this blog post: http://www.robincamille.com/2013-07-03-gephi-emda/ 
Takes a text (e.g. essay) and creates a gephi-friendly .graphml file of wordpairs, so you can see which words appear next to other words most often. 


scopus-to-gephi_author-affiliation.py takes Scopus citation data (csv) and outputs a gephi-friendly .gefx file of author name and index keyword nodes.
